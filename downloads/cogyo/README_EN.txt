◆ Explanation of various blocks and items
・CO Crafter
    This is the first block to make.
    Place a item frame on the crafting table and put redstone dust in it to turn it into a CO Crafter.
    Creating a CO Crafter unlocks the advancement [CO Crafter] and allows you to see recipes for other blocks and items on the advancements screen.
・Solar Power Generator
    This block can generate electricity using sunlight.
    If there is a block above this block or if the time zone is night, it will not be able to generate electricity.
・Battery
    This block can store electricity inside.
・Cable
    This block can transfer electricity by installing it between machines.
・Electric Furnace
    This block can smelt things using only electricity, without fuel.
    Smelting speed is 3 times faster than normal furnace.
・Storage
    This block can store 12 slots x 9 pages (6 times the chest) of items.
・Speed Hopper
    This item is a hopper that can transport items at super high speed.
・Experience Generator
    This block can generate electricity by consuming the experience point orbs above.
・Automatic Harvester
    This block will automatically plant the specified crops within the 7x7 range and automatically collect them.
    Placing a hopper on this block will automatically replenish the crop.
    The crops to collect can be specified in the UI of this block.
・Spanner
    You can switch between 3 modes by holding this item in your hand and right-clicking.
    Destroy Mode: You can mine by right-clicking while looking at the blocks in this data pack.
    Change Direction Mode: You can change the orientation of this block by right-clicking while looking at the block in this data pack.
    Edit Pipe Mode: Currently under development and cannot be used.
・Pipe
    This block moves items between blocks added in this data pack.
    Disabled by default due to a bug.
    To enable it, you need to execute the command below every tick: "function cogyo:carry/item/root"
・Others
    Most blocks have a feature called standby mode. When standby mode is turned on, electricity transfer stops.
    With this data pack, you will not be able to craft glow item frames.
    Instead, you can change it into a glow item frame by adding glow squid ink to the normal item frame.


◆ In the end
Let's have a good industrial life!
